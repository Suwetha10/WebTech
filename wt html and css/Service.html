            Many of you might be dreaming of taking a winter vacation abroad but can’t fly to your dream<br>

        <h2><b>Why Outdoor Adventure</b></h2>
        <hr width="50">
        <p>
            Our hectic modern lives require us to sit for hours in front of screens as we work, solve our <br>
            practical day to day issues and build social interactions and networks. Our body is forgotten<br>
            as our minds take over, and physical space gives way to virtual space. But our minds are in fact<br> 
            dependent on our bodies, just as virtuality exists in a physical dimension full of natural light, <br>
            breezes and singing birds. Reconnecting with the earth, and giving our bodies what they need, is essential<br>
            to finding a sustainable balance in the modern day world.
